This package contains typed Uniclass definitions (allowing the type checker to
ensure that an Uniclass code is correct) as well as the definitions of each
Uniclass code.

```typescript
import * as uniclass from "@threadway/uniclass";
// Print the title associated with a given uniclass code.
console.log(uniclass.UNICLASS[uniclass.TE_70_50_40]);
```
